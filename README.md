# Adding a "Hamburger" menu to a project

Altering a previous project by adding to navigation at the top of the page with a "hamburger" menu for mobile devices like you find on other sites.

The hamburger menu was implemented purely with CSS and on click and using a styled checkbox input tag to store the open/closed state of the menu.

Future goals: 
1. Make the hamburger menu slide in and out of the page.
2. Animate the lines in the hamburger menu to become a cross when the menu is open, and the normal 3 lines when it is closed.
