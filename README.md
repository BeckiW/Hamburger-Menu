# Sprint 2 – Someone elses Project

It's very rare that you will always start fresch when entering a web project. More likely is that you will take over someone elses code and build more features. In today's assignment you will get throwed into an existing React project – the Technigo website! 

Your task is to make sure the code is follwing the Technigo eslint styleguides and to navigate in the exisiting structure and add on a new feature – a hamburger menu on mobile.  

## How to complete this assignment

This assignment is divided into three parts. Pro tip is to start to look through the reading list – it might come useful. 

### 1. Setup the React Project

Damien fill this in.

### 2. Check the code with eslint

Start by installing eslint in the project. 

Damien add: how to install! Maybe something like this: https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/getting-started

When added, check if you have any errors in the code and correct them. Make sure the code follows the styleguides. 

### 3. Implementing a Hamburger menu

Implement a [hamburger menu](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/h/hamburger-menu.htm) for mobile devices into the existing project. You need to figure out how to place the new feature in the excisiting project without breaking it. 

The hamburger menu should be implemented purly with CSS and on click, it should fold out the menu of the page. 

To complete this assignment, you need to fork this repository, add your code in the "code" folder, and then submit a pull request on GitHub (from your repository into the technigo one) for review. Read the guide on GitHub for more info on how to do this.

### :sos: How to get help
Learning how to think as a web developer is learning how to be an expert in problem solving. So whenever you get stuck start with step 1 and continue until problem solved.

1. Google! In English, type in the error message if there is one, search within the language your're using (ie CSS, JavaScript etc).
2. Ask your code buddies in your Company.
3. Ask your fellow students in Slack.
4. Ask Damien. Please note: we are part of a sharing community - share the answer with your fellows.

As a bonus you also get practice in using and structuring React projects and improve on your css ninja skills.
